    <h1>FOOD DONATION MATCHMAKER 🍱🍱</h1>
    <p>A Food donation match maker, typically a software platform or an app, connects potential food donors (e.g., restaurants, grocery stores, farms, individuals) with recipients (e.g., food banks, charities, shelters) to prevent food waste and combat hunger. [1]  
How the "Match Maker" System Works 
The core idea is to streamline the process of getting surplus food to those in need efficiently. 
</p> 
    <ol><li>Donors post available food items: A business or individual with surplus food logs into the platform and lists what food items they have available, the quantity, and the preferred time for pickup/delivery. </li>
      <li>Recipients view and claim donations: Registered charities or food banks can log in to see available donations in their local area. They can then claim items they need. </li>
      <li>Logistics coordination: The platform facilitates communication to arrange the logistics, such as scheduling a pickup time and location. This can involve a charity worker picking up the food or a volunteer delivery system.</li></ol>
     <h4>Key Benifits</h4> <ol>
       <li>Reduces food waste: It provides an efficient channel for edible food that might otherwise be thrown away due to cosmetic imperfections, overstocking, or approaching expiration dates.</li>
       <li> Fights hunger: It ensures that food reaches vulnerable populations who struggle with food insecurity. 
</li>
       <li> Environmental impact: By diverting food from landfills, it helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide and methane) associated with food decomposition. 
</li>
    </ol>
